    Hello! As noted on the front page, my name is **Peter Bui** and I am
    currently an associate teaching professor (aka [SPF][]) in the [Computer Science and Engineering][]
    department at the [University of Notre Dame][].
    I am originally from Orange, CA and went to [La Purisima][] elementary and
    middle school and [Mater Dei][] high school.  For college, I attended the
    [University of Notre Dame][] and majored in [Computer Science and Engineering][] there.
    I liked the program so much, I stayed for graduate
    school and worked in the [Cooperative Computing Lab][] under
    [Douglas Thain][].  Eventually, I received my Master's and Ph.D. from Notre Dame,
    making me a rare **triple domer**! During my time in graduate school, I
    married my high school sweetheart, **Jennifer Rising**, and we had a
    beautiful baby boy named **Caleb**.  Upon graduating, I went to work at the
    [Computer Science][] department at the
    [University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire][].  During my first year at UWEC, our
    family grew even larger with the addition of twins girls **Abigail** and **Madeline**!
    After three great years at UWEC, my family and I have returned to Notre Dame.
