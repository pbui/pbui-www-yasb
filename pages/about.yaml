    Hello! As noted on the front page, my name is **Peter Bui** and I am
    currently an associate teaching professor (aka [SPF]) in the [Computer
    Science and Engineering] department at the [University of Notre Dame]. I am
    originally from Orange, CA and went to [La Purisima] elementary and middle
    school and [Mater Dei] high school.  For college, I attended the
    [University of Notre Dame] and majored in [Computer Science and
    Engineering] there. I liked the program so much, I stayed for graduate
    school and worked in the [Cooperative Computing Lab] under [Douglas Thain].
    Eventually, I received my Master's and Ph.D. from Notre Dame, making me a
    rare **triple domer**! During my time in graduate school, I married my high
    school sweetheart, **Jennifer Rising**, and we had a beautiful baby boy
    named **Caleb**.  Upon graduating, I went to work at the [Computer Science]
    department at the [University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire].  During my first
    year at UWEC, our family grew even larger with the addition of twins girls
    **Abigail** and **Madeline**!  After three great years at UWEC, my family
    and I have returned to Notre Dame.

    I use [Linux](http://kernel.org) extensively in my teaching, in my
    research, and at home for personal use.

      contribute and maintain a few packages.

      distribution. I have contributed and maintained a few packages, but am
      not active anymore.

    - [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org): My former laptop/desktop
      distribution. I have contributed some documentation and packages, but am
      not active anymore.

    - [i3wm](http://i3wm.org): My current window manager. I've contributed a few
      patches, but am not active anymore.

    Though far from athletic, I do enjoy playing and watching football,
    basketball, and soccer.
