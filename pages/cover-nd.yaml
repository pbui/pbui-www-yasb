    Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame

    <strong>Dear Search Committee:</strong>

    I am writing to apply for the Computer Science and Engineering teaching
    faculty position announced recently on the Interfolio website.  As a recent
    graduate of the Notre Dame Computer Science and Engineering program, I have
    spent the last three years as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at
    the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire.  Given my teaching experience,
    research background, and familiarity with the department, I believe I am a
    strong candidate for the position at the University of Notre Dame.
    
    The desire to mentor and inspire students in Computer Science is my primary
    motivation for pursuing a teaching career.  As evidenced by my CV, I have a
    fair amount of teaching experience in a number of Computer Sciences courses
    such as Fundamentals of Computing, Data Structures, Computer Architecture,
    Logic Design, Programming Challenges, and Computer Graphics.  At the
    University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire, I primarily teach courses such as
    Computer Systems, Computer Organization, and Unix Systems Programming along
    with introductory computing and programming courses to non-CS majors in
    languages such as C/C++ and Python.  Given the diversity of courses I have
    taught and taken as a student, I am well-equipped to instruct a wide
    variety of classes in the Notre Dame Computer Science and Computer
    Engineering undergraduate programs.

    Although I have taught a diverse set of Computer Science subjects, my
    doctoral research focused on constructing scalable distributed scientific
    workflows.  For my dissertation, I investigated the effectiveness of
    applying traditional compiler techniques to generate distributed workflows
    and worked with scientists to build scientific applications that were
    executed on cluster and cloud environments.  While working at the
    University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire, my research interests have broadened
    and I now work with undergraduate students on projects involving topics
    such as web services, cloud computing, embedded systems, multimedia, and
    gaming.  At Notre Dame, I would be interested in engaging students in
    research, independent study, and capstone projects.  Moreover, I would be
    open to not only collaborating with students, but also look forward to the
    opportunity to work with colleagues within the department and in the wider
    university community on various scholarly activities.

    As an alumnus of the department, I am extremely excited about the
    opportunity of contributing to the tradition of teaching excellence at the
    University of Notre Dame.  Teaching at the University of Wisconsin - Eau
    Claire for the past three years has allowed me to grow as a teacher and an
    academic professional.  During this time, I have developed my own courses,
    advised students, mentored undergraduate researchers, and participated in
    university recruitment, retention, and outreach activities.  In applying
    for this position, I hope to bring these experiences and the insight I have
    gained from working at a teaching institution back to Notre Dame.

    In closing, I would gladly welcome the opportunity to return to the
    University of Notre Dame as a professional teaching specialist in the
    Computer Science and Engineering department.  I look forward to an
    opportunity to discuss this position with you soon.  If you require any
    additional materials or information, please let me know and I would be
    happy to supply them.
